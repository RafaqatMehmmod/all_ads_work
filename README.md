# Rules Of Banner And Rectangle Ads
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/guides/ad-formats/banner
* A banner is a small bar ad that appears at the bottom or top of your content. Banner ads usually measure 320 x 50, Medium Rectangle ads usually measure 300 x 250.
Avoid placing banner / medium rectangle ads over text, image, and other clickable portions of your app to prevent accidental clicks.
Only include one ad per page or show one ad at a time if scrolling.
Avoid placing banner / medium rectangle ads in an area that interrupts the natural flow of the app to prevent accidental clicks.
Do not edit or modify banner / medium rectangle ads in any way without Facebookâ€™s written approval.
